Erlang SVG (Portable and Secure) converter for BIMI compliance. Project inspired by [php-svg-ps-converter][1].

## Summary

The choice of a specific SVG format for BIMI is intentional. Standard SVG files can include JavaScript, posing a security threat if displayed in an email client. To prevent this risk, BIMI requires the use of SVG Tiny P/S (Portable/Secure), a streamlined version of SVG that eliminates scripting and interactive elements. This guarantees that the logo remains purely a visual identifier, free from any potentially harmful code that could jeopardize the recipientâ€™s security.

This project allows you to identify all issues that your vector image has and also to convert the vector image into a more constrained and secure SVG format. 
The new format is based [SVG Tiny 1.2][2] as defined by the W3C.

## Usage

### Identifying issues

```erlang
{ok, State} = erlsvgtps_check:from_file(<<"test/assets/waffle-icon.svg">>).

% identify issues

erlsvgtps_check:issues(S).

% or getting file metadata

erlsvgtps_check:metadata(S).
```

### Convert file to a BIMI compliant format

```erlang
{ok, _NewSvgContent} = erlsvgtps_converter:from_file(<<"test/assets/waffle-icon.svg">>).
```

Some issues cannot be resolved automatically. You can retrieve them by rerunning `erlsvgtps_check` functions.  Specifically, the issues that 
require manual intervention include:

- The SVG contains an image
- The SVG is not square
- The SVG size > 32kb

### Other

For more functionality, check the exported functions from:
- `erlsvgtps_check` - the module responsible for checking issues.
- `erlsvgtps_converter` - the module responsible for converting the file.

## Running Tests

```sh
rebar3 eunit
```
